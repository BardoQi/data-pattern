# data-pattern
In software engineering, a data pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into tables of database or data in the source ocde.  It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. Data patterns are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing a database of an application or system.
